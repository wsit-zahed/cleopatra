Cleopatra Modules to be created

IN PROGRESS
---------------------------------------
You cannot call a module NoModuleAssociated as PackageManager uses that to store packages in cleovars that were installed
from cli not module


DONE
SSH Private key encryption thing
----------------------------------
Any box requiring this should have an environment variable or file
Encrypter like templater
ssh-keygen DONE
ssh-encrypt (encrypt/decrypt a private key) +
(save decrypted private key somewhere) DECRYPT WILL DO THIS GIVEN A TARGET

VERSIONING -
Should be able to specify what version of packages are required

BOX-MANAGER-SUPERCLASS
BoxManager like packagemanager. This is barely started. write down a list of what this and scaler module needs.
VERY IMPORTANT! Work out the interface for environment/box clouding, and smooth scaling. AWS and digital ocean
minimum.

30%/50% DONE

contact sebastien bergmann and everzet to ask for their views on testing the app. Get a test framework plan at least.

ALMOST DONE
Just remove all references to autopilot. also remove method calls from install, baselinuxapp, basephpapp, all methods accepting
autopilot or using autopilot parameters. make sure that everything that was covered by a runautopilot is now covered by a
control action combo
There are lots of runAutopilot methods missing. Is there a cleaner way to do this by just having autopilot variables
assigned to parameters at the beginning. So, then you provide Module(Controller), Action, available Parameters as each
step. This means that all runAutoPilot methods can be removed. each of the info files has an autoPilotVariables() method.
They can now all be removed, replaced with "exposedParams" or something. This way, each action can be listed with the
parameters it accepts. It also means that the generator will be much easier to work, with some js and httpPostInput,
the generator can look great.

Composerise core. As part of this, you can install a custom et of modules, including say cleo amd dapper in one.
update dapper, parallax and tkmn to this core.

we're ready

Configurers
-------------------
depend on templating module DONE
PHPConf - have a template file of the .ini, and an array with the php.ini defaults. Allow params to be overridden
    Send the template file, target location
    50% DONE, other template vars
ApacheConf - have a template file of the .conf, and an array with the apache defaults. Allow params to be overridden
    50% DONE, other template vars

Remove the swapPlaceholders when possible. currently its used because the value is not set in the constructor before its
used. Go through all modules updating bash lines (even in arrays) for code dependencies

Update base app to only create executors when the programExecutorTargetPath is set

PHP Module to install multiple PHP versions, or change the installed version of PHP.
Also, how does that work when executing an upgrade on PHP through a PHP script? crashy crashy?

Autopilot Definer
---------------
Set this in the Parent constructor of Models. This removes a line from all default models constructors. it should
always be the module name for a default model. This also removes confusion for a non default model it should be
Module::ModelGroup.
NO - Just replace the whole autopilot thang with setting parameters on a model (Including the Action, so there is no
need for a runAutoPilot method) before executing it. Need to make sure we

- all modules when installing if they are a dependency, should also save themselves as such DONE
- this way a dependency will probably be an apt or a module DONE
- DONE - all models have a default askStatus method. linux apps extend to execute an FS command. you can provide
  the statusCommand parameter to check with a command you provide for a 0 or non 0 exit code. you can also provide
  statusCommandExpects otherwise it will try to run the "command programNameMachine" to

System Detection - Allow the pyramid application to detect OS, OS Version and Hardware information. Have a Factory Class
in Core which detects the running OS and looks in the module for a model which Reports itself as matching The

Inter module Compatibility- one model/module should be able to call another without using a line of bash with parameter
- actually is there any benefit to this? are we looking for an exit code? If we want information returned that's more
  than an exit code we'll need to stop spawning
- If the above are working, is there any benefit to not spawning?
THIS IS DONE BY USING THE FACTORY TO GET MODELS/MODEL GROUPS FROM MODULES

To do this, create a protected (maybe static as its called from another module) method in the autopilot, use
system-detection-factory to return a compatible model, Then add a step to the AutopilotMethod Module with your
method name, and the method/class should be able to set its own parameters with a private property or something
