The ultimate Configuration Management and Systems Automation package in PHP.

Can be used to set up a Development Client, Development Server, Testing Servers, SCM Servers
or Production Application Servers in minutes, out of the box, with Zero configuration across multiple Operating Systems.

You can also create far more complex or niche systems completely configured by code across platforms.

Using Convention over Configuration, a lot of common Configuration Management tasks can be completed with little or
no extra implementation work.
